A fully automated VTU result-fetching system that utilizes **Machine Learning**, **Selenium**, and **Flask-SocketIO**. This tool automates the tedious process of fetching results for multiple USNs, solving CAPTCHAs using a trained Deep Learning model, processing subject data, and calculating SGPAs, finally exporting everything into a comprehensive Excel report.

## 🚀 Features

### 🤖 ML-Based CAPTCHA Solver
* **Deep Learning Core:** Powered by a custom trained TensorFlow/Keras model (`vtu_captcha_predictor.h5`).
* **Computer Vision:** Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding) to enhance prediction accuracy.
* **Zero Intervention:** Automatically predicts and inputs VTU CAPTCHAs during the scraping process.

### 🕸️ VTU Result Automation (Selenium)
* **Bulk Processing:** Iterates through a CSV list of USNs automatically.
* **Deep Scraping:** Extracts subject-wise marks, Internal Assessment (IA), External Assessment (EA), Totals, Result Status (P/F), and Percentages.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Automatically handles timeouts, alerts, and invalid USNs.

### ⚡ Real-Time Log Streaming
* **Live Feedback:** Integrated **Flask-SocketIO** pushes backend scraping logs to the browser instantly.
* **Interactive UI:** Watch the bot work in real-time on the web dashboard.

### 📊 SGPA Calculator & Excel Export
* **Dynamic Subject Detection:** Automatically extracts all unique subjects found across the fetched results.
* **Smart Credit Input:** User enters credits *once* for each subject via the UI.
* **Auto-Calculation:** Computes SGPA for every student based on VTU grading logic.
* **Rich Excel Report:** Generates `vtu_results.xlsx` containing raw scores + calculated SGPA.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.
* **Google Chrome** browser installed.
* **ChromeDriver** matching your Chrome version.

### 2. Install Dependencies
You can install all required packages using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio eventlet selenium pandas tensorflow opencv-python beautifulsoup4 openpyxl
3. Setup ChromeDriver
Check your Chrome version (Settings > About Chrome).

Download the matching ChromeDriver from the official site.

Place the chromedriver.exe (Windows) or chromedriver (Mac/Linux) in your project folder or add it to your System PATH.

4. Prepare Input Data
Create or edit the students.csv file in the root directory. It should contain a header (optional, depending on code logic) or a simple list of USNs.

Example students.csv:

Code snippet

1GD23CS402
1GD23CS403
1GD23CS404
🖥️ Usage Guide
Step 1: Run the Application
Start the Flask server by running:

Bash

python app.py
You should see output indicating the server is running (usually on http://127.0.0.1:5000).

Step 2: Access the Dashboard
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Step 3: Start Fetching
Paste the current VTU Result URL (e.g., https://results.vtu.ac.in/...) into the input field.

Click "Start Fetching".

The logs section will stream real-time updates as the bot solves CAPTCHAs and scrapes data.

Step 4: Calculate SGPA
Once scraping is complete, the "Calculate SGPA" section will unlock.

The system will list all subjects found. Enter the Course Credits for each subject (e.g., Maths = 4, Lab = 1).

Click "Calculate & Download".

Step 5: View Results
The system will generate vtu_results.xlsx. Open this file to view the comprehensive report including the calculated SGPA for every student.
